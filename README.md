## üéØ Project Overview

The DPW Micro-Tasking Platform provides short-term digital work opportunities for youth participants by allowing them to tag images from their communities. The application focuses on infrastructure assessment through 360¬∞ panoramic images, with a consensus-based quality assurance system and tiered payment structure.

### Key Features

- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for low-end smartphones with lightweight, performant architecture
- **Consensus-Based Quality**: Majority vote system determines ground truth for payments
- **Tiered Payment System**: Base pay (KES 760) + accuracy-based bonuses up to 30%
- **Real-Time Progress**: Daily task tracking with visual progress indicators
- **Admin Management**: Complete user and campaign management system

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes (Full-Stack Architecture)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with phone number verification
- **State Management**: Zustand for client-side state
- **UI Components**: Headless UI + Custom components
- **Development**: Docker Compose for local PostgreSQL

### Design Philosophy

Inspired by Apple's design principles and showcased interfaces on [Refero.design](https://refero.design) and [Mobbin.com](https://mobbin.com):

- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Clean, white-dominated interface with strategic red accents
- **Card-Based Layout**: Organized information presentation with soft shadows
- **Typography-First**: Inter font with strong hierarchy and high contrast
- **Touch-Optimized**: 44px minimum touch targets for mobile accessibility

### Color Palette

- **Primary**: White (#FFFFFF) - Dominant background
- **Secondary**: Black (#1D1D1F) - Text and standard elements  
- **Accent**: Red (#EF4444) - CTAs, active states, notifications
- **Muted**: Gray tones for subtle elements

## üì± Application Flow

### Worker Experience

1. **Authentication**: Phone number + Settlement selection
2. **Dashboard**: Daily progress tracking and news feed
3. **Task Interface**: Single 360¬∞ image + Yes/No question
4. **Progress Tracking**: Visual completion indicators
5. **Completion**: Daily target achievement confirmation

### Admin Experience

1. **User Management**: Register workers, assign settlements
2. **Campaign Creation**: Upload CSV images, set questions
3. **Settlement Assignment**: Target specific communities
4. **Reporting**: Generate payment and activity reports

### System Processing

1. **Work Window**: 6 AM - 6 PM daily task availability
2. **Consensus Engine**: Nightly majority vote processing
3. **Payment Calculation**: Base pay + tiered accuracy bonuses
4. **Quality Assurance**: Automated ground truth determination

## üí∞ Payment Structure

### Base Pay
- **KES 760** guaranteed for completing ~300 daily tasks

### Quality Bonuses
- **90%+ accuracy**: 30% bonus (KES 228)
- **80-89% accuracy**: 20% bonus (KES 152)  
- **70-79% accuracy**: 10% bonus (KES 76)
- **Below 70%**: No bonus (base pay only)

### Example Calculation
Worker completes 300 tasks with 92% accuracy:
- Base Pay: KES 760
- Quality Bonus: KES 228 (30% tier)
- **Total: KES 988**

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Core Entities

- **Users**: Workers and Admins with settlement assignments
- **Settlements**: Geographic locations (Mji wa Huruma, Kayole Soweto, Kariobangi)
- **Campaigns**: Task collections with questions and images
- **Images**: 360¬∞ panoramic URLs from CSV uploads
- **Responses**: Worker answers (Yes/No) to images
- **DailyReports**: Payment calculations and analytics
- **News**: Admin announcements and updates

### Sample Data

The application includes seed data with:
- 3 settlements from Nairobi and Machakos
- Sample 360¬∞ panoramic images from Wikimedia Commons
