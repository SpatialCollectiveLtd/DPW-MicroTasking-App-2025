# Testing the Login Page

## Current Issue Resolution

### The Problem
You were redirected from `/login` to `/dashboard` because you had an active authentication session.

### The Solution
1. **Clear your session** by visiting: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signout
2. **Then visit**: http://localhost:3000/login

### Alternative Method
Clear browser storage:
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Clear "Local Storage" and "Session Storage" for localhost:3000

## Database Issues Fixed
- Restarted the PostgreSQL container

## Login Page Features
- **Desktop**: Clean white card on light background (Relume style)
- **Mobile**: Dark immersive experience (Opal style)
